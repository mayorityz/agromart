                      Joining and starting a shop on Martfury is free. There are
                      three basic selling fees: a listing fee, a transaction
                      fee, and a payment processing fee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It costs USD 0.20 to publish a listing to the marketplace.
                      A listing lasts for four months or until the item is sold.
                      Once an item sells, there is a 3.5% transaction fee on the
                      sale price (not including shipping costs). If you accept
                      payments with PayPal, there is also a payment processing
                      fee based on their fee structure.

                      It’s easy to set up a shop on Martfury. Create an Martfury
                      account (if you don’t already have one), set your shop
                      location and currency, choose a shop name, create a
                      listing, set a payment method (how you want to be paid),
                      and finally set a billing method (how you want to pay your
                      Martfuryfees).

                      If you accept payments with PayPal, funds from PayPal
                      sales on Martfury will be deposited into your PayPal
                      account. We encourage sellers to use a PayPal Business
                      account and not a Personal account, as personal accounts
                      are subject to monthly receiving limits and cannot accept
                      payments from buyers that are funded by a credit card.

                      Listing fees are billed for $0.20 USD, so if your bank’s
                      currency is not USD, the amount may differ based on
                      changes in the exchange rate.

                      No, a credit or debit card is not required to create a
                      shop. To be verified as a seller you have the choice to
                      use either a credit card or to register via PayPal. You
                      will not incur any charges until you open your shop and
                      publish your listings.
